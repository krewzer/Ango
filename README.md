# Ango
Ango is a hackathon project promoting United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals which helps with outreach for NGOs. The project is presented as a browser extension for implemnting it's core idea. So, we pitched an idea for a project which would let the youth access to this information with the help of a non intrusive New Tab page with search bar functionality which will present the NGO's outreach data.

Our idea is a start page for computers in institutions, school libraries etc. It presents flyer for NGOs outreach everytime one opens a new tab on their browser which will have NGO's information and donation links. The background would be a static google map's marked background which will be showing the NGO's office location.

Any NGO can outreach their data to the Ango service by submitting their data to a form which would be linked on the extension footer without any royalty as such. With every search we would donate half of all generated advertising revenues to charities that are registered on platform.
